I am a first-year master student majoring Computer Engineering at 
[NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/).

Before moving to Brooklyn, I was fortunately a member of [SUSTech SQLab](https://sqlab-sustech.github.io/) supervised 
by [Prof. Yepang Liu](https://yepangliu.github.io/). I worked on two JavaScript static analysis research projects with 
my teammate [Ziqin Wang](https://github.com/ziqin).
